### Summary for video #4: Node Server Setup
```
C:\Booking-Project\Booking-System> npm i express
```

Install nodemon.
With nodemon, we don't have to reload the server when making some changes, Ctrl+S at the `server.js` file will do.
```
C:\Booking-Project\Booking-System> npm install -g nodemon
```
